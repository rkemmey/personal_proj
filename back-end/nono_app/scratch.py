"""
TO DO:
- clean up puzzle logic
- create many puzzles

- submit button not working correctly, ensure talking to right puzzle
--> refreshing vite gives us a new puzzle but i didnt refresh the django server, is it doing it for me?
- put css code in a separate file, make grid bigger

- user logins to save puzzle progress
- store generated puzzles in a PostgreSQL database instead of generating them randomly every time

- puzzles are actual pictures
